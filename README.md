```

```

const element = <div className="/* Suggestions appear here */" />;
```

  composes: button-primary from global; /* Hover over button-primary */
}
```

#### In JSX/TSX Files

<div className="button-primary layout-flex" /> {/* Hover over class names */}

<!-- Hover over class names -->
```

2. Type "PostCSSense: Show CSS Classes"
3. A panel will open showing all CSS classes with their properties
4. Use the search box to filter classes by name

## Configuration

You can configure the extension through VS Code settings:

1. Open Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "PostCSSense"
3. Update the "CSS Path" setting with your preferred path

Alternatively, add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "postcssense.cssPath": "path/to/your/css/file.css"
}
```

### CSS Import Resolution

The extension automatically handles various import formats in your CSS files:

- **Package imports** (from `node_modules`):

  ```css
  @import '@package-name/style.css';
  @import '~package-name/style.css';
  ```

- **Relative imports** (relative to the current file):
  ```css
  @import './components/button.css';
  @import '../styles/variables.css';
  ```

### CSS Global Class Support

The extension supports various syntaxes for global CSS classes:

- **Standard CSS classes**:

  ```css
  .button-primary {
    ...;
  }
  ```

- **Global function syntax**:

  ```css
  .global(button-primary) {
    ...;
  }
  global(.button-primary) {
    ...;
  }
  ```

- **CSS Modules :global syntax**:
  ```css
  :global .button-primary {
    ...;
  }
  :global(.button-primary) {
    ...;
  }
  ```

All these formats are properly recognized for autocompletion and hover information.
